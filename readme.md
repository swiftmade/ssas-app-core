```js
{
    "react-native-fs": "^2.13.3",
    "react-native-message-bar": "^2.0.10",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.2",
    "react-native-webview": "^5.4.6",
    "react-native-zip-archive": "^4.0.0",
    "react-navigation": "^1.5.8"
}
```

 Add this package as a dependency:

```bash
yarn add ssas-app-core
```

##### 4. Link `ssas-enketo` with your Android and iOS projects.

###### Android

```bash
# Creates symlink for Android.
# Run this in the root folder of your project.

cd android/app/src/main/assets
ln -s ../../../../../node_modules/ssas-enketo/www www
```

###### iOS

- Open your app's iOS project in XCode.
- Open your app's root directory in Finder and go to `node_modules/ssas-enketo`
- Drag and drop www folder to your XCode project. (As a reference. Don't copy)


##### 5. Integrating SSAS App Core with your React Native App
